Contributing Code
-----------------

Clone this repository on Gitlab, modify your changes in your local fork (I recommend creating a branch),
commit your changes, and submit your branch as a pull request on Gitlab.

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Obtaining Commit Access
-----------------------

As mentioned earlier, the owner of this repo, Bryant Mairs, does not attend UCSC and does not actively use this repository for a dissertation. Other people are welcome to join as stewards of this project, ideally able to maintain it for several years. If you have used this project and are interested in maintaining and improving it, you must have successfully contributed a pull request. After that, file an issue explaining why you want to join this project and how many years you expect left in your graduate program.

Valid Contributions
-------------------

The goal of this template is to be the smallest template possible that also satisfies the style requirements laid forth by the University of California, Santa Cruz. Anything that is not specified should be left out of the template. This will reduce the amount of bikeshedding discussions and also enable the most flexibility for users of this template. Pull requests that do not have a reason for every change referenced to the official UCSC style requirements will most likely be rejected.

Pull Requests
-------------

Pull requests (PR) are the main method for contributing to this repository. Every PR should have a clear title and description summarizing all changes. Furthermore every individual change should have a separate commit, with their own clear title and description. Commit descriptions include a rationale for the change, a description of why this way was chosen if there were several possible options, and a link to any external document describing the requirements (like the UCSC dissertation style guidelines).
